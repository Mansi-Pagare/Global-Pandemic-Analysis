Objective

The primary objective of this project is to visualize the global impact of historical disease outbreaks, focusing on the scale and geographic spread of pandemics throughout history. By analyzing death toll estimates and the affected regions, this project aims to provide insights into the severity of past pandemics, enabling healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers to better understand trends and inform future preparedness strategies.
Data Analysis

The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing process, which included:

    Normalization of year data (adjusting for BC years and aligning to 2024).
    Handling Missing Data: Filling in gaps in location and death toll estimates.
    Calculated Fields: Creation of new fields for analysis, such as combining locations and categorizing disease types.
    Death Toll Filter: Focus on pandemics with death tolls exceeding 2 million for in-depth analysis.
    Geographic Grouping: Assigning countries to their respective continents to simplify geographic analysis.

Visualizations

Key visualizations include:

    Map Visualization: Interactive map showing the global spread of pandemics, color-coded by death toll.
    Treemap: A hierarchical treemap representing pandemics by death toll size.
    Bar Chart: A comparison of death tolls across different disease categories, such as Plague, Pox, and Influenza.
    Timeline: A dynamic timeline displaying pandemics over time, highlighting major outbreaks with death tolls greater than 2 million.

Tools and Technologies

    Python: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and enrichment tasks, including creating calculated fields and handling missing values.
    Tableau: Used for building the interactive visualizations such as maps, treemaps, bar charts, and timelines.
    Excel: Initially used for cleaning and organizing the data before importing it into Tableau.
